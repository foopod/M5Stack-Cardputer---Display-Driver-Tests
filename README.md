# Display Driver Test for M5Stack Cardputer

I made this repo to compare the performance of two display drivers...

**st7789py.py** -> https://github.com/russhughes/st7789py_mpy
(this uses the generic esp32-s3 1.22.1 firmware)

**s3lcd** -> https://github.com/russhughes/s3lcd
(this uses the [s3lcd firmware](https://github.com/russhughes/s3lcd/tree/main/firmware/ESP32_GENERIC_S3_8MiB))

This is based on the tiny toast example found [here](https://russhughes.github.io/st7789py_mpy/examples/tiny_toasters.html).
